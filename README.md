# DataScience_Stack

StackOverflow is fantastic resource for any programmer and for my final capstone I wanted to take a closer look at StackOverflow questions using NLP, but also develop a machine learning model to predict whether a question asked on StackOverflow will be answered or not.

#### 1A_WebScraping_InfoGrab.ipynb & 1B_WebScraping_Pages.ipynb
These notebooks show how I scraped StackOverflow questions and other elements of the site

#### 2_DataCleaning_miniEDA.ipynb
This notebook focuses on cleaning the questions and using NLP to look at bigrams, trigrams and most commonly used terms

#### 2P_pyLDAvis_Gensim_Python.ipynb
#### 2Q_pyLDAvis_Gensim_SQL.ipynb
#### 2R_pyLDAvis_Gensim_R.ipynb
These notebooks focus on topic modeling for Python, SQL and R tagged questions -> The interactive topic models are also part of my R Shiny App found at https://kozissnikb.shinyapps.io/DataScience_Stack/

#### 3_Model_Expansion.ipynb
Shows my TFIDF Vectorizer & Logistic Regression model including and excluding some simple features

#### 4_LIME_Demo.ipynb
TFIDF Vectorizer & Logistic Regression model to predict whether a question will be answered on StackOverflow or not, including an interactive widget and LIME Text Explainer.

#### DataScience_Stack folder
Includes everything for my Shiny App (found at: https://kozissnikb.shinyapps.io/DataScience_Stack/), any data referenced, as well as all R code.
